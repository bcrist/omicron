# Omicron
[bengine](https://github.com/magicmoremagic/bengine)

## Building
bengine uses the Ninja build system.  The Ninja build script is generated by a
custom Lua frontend.  Most development is done in Visual Studio, so `.vcxproj`
files are also provided, however they may use slightly different settings
compared to Ninja builds.

Some files are partially or fully generated.  This includes Ragel lexers and
Lua scripts embedded in source files as comments, which are subsequently
executed by the `limp` tool (included as part of bengine).

### Build Requirements
 - [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)
 - [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/) or [Visual C++ Build Tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools) (Windows)
 - [Visual Leak Detector](https://vld.codeplex.com/) (Windows; optional)
 - [Ragel](http://www.colm.net/open-source/ragel/) (optional; code generation)
 - [Limp](https://github.com/magicmoremagic/bengine-limp) (included; code generation)

Boost must be downloaded and extracted separately.  Set the `BOOST_HOME`
environment variable to point to the path where the archive was extracted.
The SQLite source amalgamation is distributed within this repository.  All
all other libraries are referenced as git submodules.

### Building on Windows
```
:: Ensure BOOST_HOME environment variable is set:
> SET BOOST_HOME=C:\path\to\boost

:: Clone submodule repositories and build external libraries:
> setup

:: Open a VS command prompt for development and testing:
> workspace

:: Regenerate build.ninja:
> ninja configure!
:: Or alternatively:
> limp -f build.ninja

:: Build all modules, tools, and demos:
> ninja

:: List all top-level targets:
> ninja -t targets

:: Run all limp rules: (changes are not always detected normally by Ninja)
> ninja limp!

:: Clean up intermediate ninja build files and libraries:
> ninja clean!

:: Clean up all build files (Ninja and VS; useful before copying/moving repo to another location)
> ninja deinit!
```
